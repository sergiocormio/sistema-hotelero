/**
 * This is a generated sub-class of _Serializable.as and is intended for behavior
 * customization.  This class is only generated when there is no file already present
 * at its target location.  Thus custom behavior that you add here will survive regeneration
 * of the super-class. 
 *
 * NOTE: Do not manually modify the RemoteClass mapping unless
 * your server representation of this class has changed and you've 
 * updated your ActionScriptGeneration,RemoteClass annotation on the
 * corresponding entity
